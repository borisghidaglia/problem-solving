"""This problem was asked by Google.

An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node
holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, which is an XOR of the next
node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an add(element) which
adds the element to the end, and a get(index) which returns the node at index.

If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have
access to get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions that converts between nodes
and memory addresses.
